# Data normalization and visualization

This is a full tutorial of HiCtool. The tutorial steps have to be followed in sequence. At the normalization step, choose the preferred method.

The explicit-factor correction model (2.1.) is applied to normalize intra-chromosomal data only. The matrix balancing approach (2.2.) normalizes globally intra- and inter-chromosomal contact maps.
