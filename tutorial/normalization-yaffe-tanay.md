# Data normalization with explicit-factor correction model of Yaffe and Tanay

This pipeline illustrates the procedure to normalize Hi-C **intra-chromosomal contact data only** following the explicit-factor model of [Yaffe and Tanay](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v43/n11/abs/ng.947.html).

If you are looking for a global normalization procedure for both intra- and inter-chromosomal maps, go to [this section where the data are normalizing using a matrix balancing approach](/tutorial/normalization-matrix-balancing.md).
